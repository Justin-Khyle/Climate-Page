    <!--Paragraph (facts) -->
    <p> Los Angeles has been home to some of the most extravagant minds since the city's construction. Los Angeles,
        otherwise known as LA, recently had their record-breaking fire spread on January 7, 2025. The fire erupted
        during the morning in Pacific Palisades east of Malibu. Before long, the flames grew to
        23,448 acres before the fire could be contained. The projected wildfire conditions across California from
        February through May 2025 exhibit significant regional variability, with distinct climatic and fuel moisture
        patterns influencing fire potential in the northern and southern portions of the state.
        In Northern California, an active jet stream is forecast to deliver near to above-average precipitation
        throughout February and March, followed by a transition toward warmer and drier conditions in April and May.
        The resultant vegetation growth ("green-up") and persistent snowpack at mid-to-upper elevations are expected
        to inhibit fire spread during this period.
    </p>
    <p>
        Consequently, significant wildfire potential is anticipated to remain within normal thresholds, consistent
        with historical trends of subdued large-fire activity during these months. Conversely, Southern California
        has recorded a substantially drier-than-average wet season, with cumulative precipitation since October 1,
        2024, falling below 25% of the norm across most regions.
        This prolonged deficit has exacerbated drought conditions, with severe to extreme drought classifications
        now widespread. As a result, the South Coast faces a slight to moderately elevated probability of
        above-normal large-fire potential over the next four months. While limited grass and fine-fuel growth may
        reduce the likelihood of fires driven by such fuels, the increased aridity has heightened the risk of fires
        involving timber and heavier fuel loads.
        In summary, while Northern California is expected to maintain typical wildfire potential due to favorable
        moisture and fuel conditions, Southern California—particularly the South Coast—faces an increased likelihood
        of significant fire activity, driven by persistent drought and desiccated fuels.
